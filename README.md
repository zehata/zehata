## Current projects:
- NUSMods: I used it significantly while studying at NUS, so I feel like contributing back. You can check out my PRs to have an idea of the quality of my work in production codebases.
- Personal portfolio website: Working on adding tests and code coverage toolings. You can see how I am inventing new tech and pushing the boundaries of frontend development.
- Navaday: Current freelance project for a travel agent SME. Private freelance work, I will make it generic eventually.

## AI use disclaimer
- I have used machine vision libraries including openCV and Mediapipe for my work.
- I don't use any generative AI in my work --- neither LLMs nor image diffusion. I am also not interested in any work involving these.
