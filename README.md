## Current projects:
- NUSMods: I used it significantly while studying at NUS, so I feel like contributing back. You can check out my PRs to have an idea of the quality of my work in production codebases and my TypeScript/React skills.
- Personal portfolio website ([zehata.dev](https://zehata.dev)): Working on adding tests and code coverage toolings. You can see how I am inventing new tech and pushing the boundaries of frontend development. You can check out the repo to see my abilities in architecturing a project, and my TypeScript/React/Next.js/PostgreSQL/AWS skills
- Navaday: Current freelance project for a travel agent SME. Private freelance work, I will make it generic eventually.

## AI use disclaimer
- I have used machine vision libraries including openCV and Mediapipe for my work.
- I don't use any generative AI in my work --- neither LLMs nor image diffusion. I am also not interested in any work involving these.
